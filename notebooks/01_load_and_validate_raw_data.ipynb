      "Phoenix to London - outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. The problem we had started on our return flight home. We boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. After being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. I was attempting to work but when I went to plug in my laptop battery I found that there was no adapter for me to use. Since I could no longer work I decided to put a movie on. The tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. The flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and I give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. I decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. You can imagine my surprise when I saw him sitting in business class with a TV screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. At this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. It doesn't make sense to me. Just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in Phoenix to face another issue. We waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in London. We've flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. The difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn't made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home. Well this time nobody informed us so we stood there waiting for 45 minutes at the baggage claim before we were told.\n",

      "On past experience I chose BA for our long haul return flight to South America from the UK. Not until I got to the payment stage did I realise that of the 4 flights only one short flight to Madrid was actually on a BA plane. The others were with Iberia Airways. I understand that flight operators have to partner with other agencies but you would expect then that they would adhere to standards expected of the original operator. Standards were very poor. No inflight entertainment on a 12 and 13 hour flight. Poor food and on the last leg of the journey we were even expected to pay for our food. What is this a budget airline at full blown prices? Again on this last leg the toilets weren't flushing! So at oyr destination they were almost full. My advice would be check who you're actually flying with.\n",

      "LHR-CPH-LHR Business Class. This is a joke. Scruffy aircraft with ripped upholstery dirty cabin and chaotic/slow \"service\". I know it's a short flight (90 mins) but it shouldn't take over an hour to get one cup of cold stewed tea. Flight attendants including their \"manager\" didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing. Seats are actually narrow economy 3x3 configuration with the middle one kept vacant. Inflight entertainment? Easy there isn't any. For the price I paid this was an absolute disgrace. I seriously think I'd have a better experience with EasyJet.\n",

      "I flew with British Airways with my mother from Paphos to Manchester. She had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. I was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. Then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! I think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. I will never fly with BA again.\n",
