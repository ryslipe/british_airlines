      "I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with   but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment Firstly   no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2 Theres a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldnt help with the details Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working Not good enough for an expensive ticket Finally got to board and the staff are incredible   but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention The seat would not easily convert to a bed It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby Again not what youd expect from a premium product I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers Given that I told them specifically where Id left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it All in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service BA isnt offering it at the moment If it is essential that you have to fly really dont bother with first unless you have to   or go to another airline The company just dont care....0\n",

      "Dubai to London on 5th December Flight was ok   seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross  Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose Announcement made at the beginning about masks Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything  Not like the crew were busy either did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didnt see them Of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines....0\n",

      "This is my first flight since January We have had three cancellations which BA handled superbly But this flight went ahead Check in at LHR was fine no fast track se unity at T5 Galleries South lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly Followed this with a shower they are open limited hours Flight on time and well presented A321 Staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times Landed on time priority baggage cane off late Overall happy with product and would use again....1\n",

      "Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10 10 Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge They have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in 2020 The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea The one thing   which I mean as constructive criticism though   I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice Thats fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received....1\n",

      "We had a flight to Santorini from LHR at 810am As the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage We arrived at the airport at 700am and the queue for check in was incredibly long because some desks were closed It took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the check in had closed at 725am and that we had missed the flight British Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime The lady at the desk booked us on a flight to Athens instead telling us that the costs to reach Santorini would be reimbursed We had to book two tickets worth £200 for a flight to Santorini on the same day We have just received a response from the Customer Relations service telling us that we would get nothing....0\n",
